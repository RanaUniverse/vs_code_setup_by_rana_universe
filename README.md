#VS Code Install with All Settings

This vs code installation is my own choice where i am keeping my own settings and themes and shortcuts so that i can easily use this script to install my vs code in any machine without much changes.

This will directly install vs code latest version and the extensions as required.

Offline Process for this i need .vsix file for the extensions and .deb file for vs code app.
