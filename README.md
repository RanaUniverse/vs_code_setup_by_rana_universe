# VS Code Install with All Settings

### ```./install_process.sh```

This vs code installation is my own choice where i am keeping my own settings and themes and shortcuts so that i can easily use this script to install my vs code in any machine without much changes.

This will directly install vs code latest version and the extensions as required.

This need a Internet Connection to downoad the vs code and the extensions i want to use..

The main.py file is for checking python file.
